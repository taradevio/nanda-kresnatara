                <p class="">Ahoy! I'm Nanda, a Frontend Developer with a background in English Literature. Whilst storytelling has always been a part of my journey, I've found a new way to express creativity and problem-solving through code.</p>
                <p class="my-3">Currently, I'm focused on building functional and user-friendly web experiences, and I occasionally enjoy designing layouts to bring ideas to life. I love working on projects that make a real impact, whether it's improving accessibility, enhancing user interactions, or creating something meaningful from scratch.</p>
                <p>I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills, and my goal is to use my coding experiences to provide valueâ€”whether for businesses, communities, or individuals</p>
